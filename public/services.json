        "description": "Our new 4 Week FB Low Impact is a uniquely challenging program that can help you build muscle and burn fat, without any jumping at all. All of the workouts are low impact, but that doesn't mean they're easy; a person with virtually any fitness level can benefit from the smart workouts in this program. The main training styles are strength training, Pilates, low impact HIIT/cardio, functional movements, balance, coordination, and flexibility. You'll be doing a different workout video every single dayâ€”no repeats. Workouts are 5 days a week, with an optional 6th day recovery-based workout. With that said, this program can be completed at a much slower pace in order to be even more beginner friendly. Even if you complete this program at a pace of 2 workouts per week, it will still be effective. All the way through, we provide both extra credit workouts (if you feel like you want to push yourself harder), as well as easier alternative workouts, if the scheduled routine is particularly challenging. This program can lead to weight loss and a noticeable change in body composition. Your energy levels may be higher, your health and mood are likely to improve, as well as your strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance.",

        "description": "FB Blend is a fun, challenging, and flexible workout plan; you get to choose the length of your workouts each day, roughly 35 or 55 minutes a day, depending on your own schedule and energy levels. Each day of this program offers a unique workout - you'll never have to do the same video twice. It's a smart combination of HIIT, strength training, functional movement, Pilates, supersets, cardio, plyometrics, stretching, yoga and more. All you need is dumbbells and even if you don't have dumbbells, you can still get in a great workout using your own bodyweight. Because you pick the length of your workout each day, this program is essentially two of our most popular programs in one; FB30 (our 30 minute program) and FBFit (our 50 minute program). If you love FB Sweat, or FB Burn, you will love FB Blend because of the shared flexibility in actual workout length. ",
